# Seeing Green
Seeing Green is a augmented reality walking tour of the sustainability features in downtown Raleigh, NC.  More information can be found about the walking tour at the [Raleigh Sustainability Walking Tour Website](http://www.raleighnc.gov/news/content/CorNews/Articles/SustainabilityWalkingTour.html).

## To do:
1. POI locations displayed in the AR view are no longer accurate.  This needs to be fixed immediately.
2. The interface needs significant work.  The overall structure should be changed to a NavbarViewController.
3. The data is currently hardcoded into the app. This needs to be pulled from a JSON data service (service and data processing have not been started on).
4. A list of all POIs needs to be made.
