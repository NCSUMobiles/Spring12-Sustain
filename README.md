# Seeing Green
Seeing Green is a augmented reality walking tour of the sustainability features in downtown Raleigh, NC.  More information can be found about the walking tour at the [Raleigh Sustainability Walking Tour Website](http://www.raleighnc.gov/news/content/CorNews/Articles/SustainabilityWalkingTour.html).

## To do:
1. The data is currently hardcoded into the app. This needs to be pulled from a JSON data service (service and data processing have not been started on).
2. Support needs to be added to walk through the tour in order.
3. The list view of the POIs needs to look better.
4. The interface as a whole needs significant work.
5. The storyboard needs to be cleaned up.
